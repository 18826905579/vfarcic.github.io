Abstract
========

It's been a bit over a year since Docker released its first "production ready" release. A new door was opened and many of us stepped through. We are creating immutable containers and deploying them to production in a much easier and more reliable ways than we did before. However, with widespread usage of Docker a huge number of new possibilities started to emerge.

Can we automatically scale (and de-scale) services depending on traffic and server load? Do we need to know where will the applications be deployed? Can we treat all our servers as one big "server farm"? What can we do with auto-discovery? Can we recuperate from failures without human intervention? Can we truly accomplish zero-downtime?

Learning Outcomes
=================

* Fully automated deployment to a server farm
* Automated scaling
* Auto-discovery
* Failure recuperation
* Zero-downtime
* Automated self-healing
