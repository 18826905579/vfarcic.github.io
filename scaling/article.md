History of Failed Initiatives
=============================

Working on small greenfield projects is great. The last one I ws involved with was during summer 2015 and, even though it had its share of problems, it was a real pleasure. Being small and, relatively, new allowed us to choose technologies, practices and frameworks we liked. Shall we use microservices? Yes, why not. Shall we try Polymer and GoLang? Sure! Not having a baggage that holds you down is a wonderful feeling. If we made a wrong decision, that would put us back for a week but it won't put in danger years of work someone else did before us. Simply put, there was no legacy system to think about and be afraid of.

Most of my career was not like that. I had the opportunity, or a curse, to work on big inherited systems. I worked for companies that existed long before I joined them and, for better or worse, already had their systems in place. I had to balance the need for innovation and improvement with obvious requirement that existing business must continue operating uninterrupted. During all those years I was continuously trying to discover new ways to improve those systems and, it pains me to admit but many of those attempts were a failure.

Continuous Integration (CI), Delivery and Deployment (CD)
---------------------------------------------------------

Discovering CI and, later on CD, was one of the crucial points in my career. It all made perfect sense. Integration phase back in those days could last anything from days to weeks or even months. It was the period we all dreaded. After months of work performed by different teams working on different services or applications the first day of the integration phase was the definition of hell on earth. If I wouldn't know better, I'd say that Dante was a developer and wrote Infierno during the integration phase.

When the dreaded day comes we would all come to the office with grim faces. Only whispers could be heard while integration engineer would announce that the whole system is set up and the game could begin. He would turn it on and, sometimes, the result would be nothing. Months of work in isolation would prove, one more time, to be a disaster. Services and applications could not be integrated and the long process of fixing problems would begin. In some cases we would need to redo weeks of work. Requirements defined in advance were, as always, prone to different interpretations and those differences are nowhere more noticeable than in the integration phase.

Then **eXtreme programming** practices came to existence and, with them, **continuous integration (CI)**. The sole idea that integration should be done continuously today sounds as something obvious. Duh! Of course you should not wait until the last moment to integrate! Back then, in the waterfall era, such a thing was not so obvious. We started checking out every commit, running static analysis, unit and functional tests, packaging, deploying and running integration tests. If any of those phases failed, we would abandon what we were doing and made fixing the problem detected by the pipeline our priority. The pipeline itself was fast. Minutes after someone would make a commit to the repository we would get a notification if something failed. Later on **continuous delivery** started to take ground and we would have confidence that every commit that passed the whole pipeline could be deployed to production. We could do even better and not only attest that each build is production ready but apply **continuous deployment** and, simply, deploy every build without waiting for (manual) confirmation from anyone. And the best part of all that was that everything was fully automated.

If was a dream come true. Literally! It was a dream. It wasn't something we managed to turn into reality. Why was that? We made mistakes. We though that CI/CD is operations (today we'd call them **DevOPS**) task. We though that we could create a process that wraps around applications and services. We though that CI tools and frameworks are ready. We though that architecture, testing, business negotiations and other tasks and teams are the job of someone else. We were wrong. I was wrong.

Today I know that successful CI/CD means that no stone can be left unturned.
