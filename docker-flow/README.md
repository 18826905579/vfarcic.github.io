Docker Flow: Continuous Deployment Docker Containers Flow
=========================================================

Abstract
--------

Docker Flow is a project aimed towards creating an easy to use continuous deployment flow. It depends on Docker Engine, Docker Compose, Consul, and Registrator. Each of those tools is proven to bring value and are recommended for any Docker deployment.

The goal of the project is to add features and processes that are currently missing inside the Docker ecosystem. The project, at the moment, solves the problems of blue-green deployments, relative scaling, and proxy service discovery and reconfiguration. Many additional features will be added soon.

This talk will be a live demo of the Docker Flow open source project followed by a discussion related to the Docker ecosystem.
