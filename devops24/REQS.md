# Workshop Prerequisites

A fully operational Kubernetes cluster with NGINX Ingress controller and a default StorageClass. The following Kubernetes platforms were tested for this course. Please note that Gists are provided in case you need to create a cluster specific for this course.

* [devops24-docker.sh](https://gist.github.com/vfarcic/3fbf532b1716d40ae60552baf83b8ed1): Docker for Mac with 4 CPUs, 4GB RAM, and with nginx Ingress controller.
* [devops24-minikube.sh](https://gist.github.com/vfarcic/f5863c66867bbe87722998683ea20c41): minikube with 4 CPUs, 4GB RAM, and with ingress, storage-provisioner, and default-storageclass addons enabled.
* [devops24-kops.sh](https://gist.github.com/vfarcic/0552be5ccbd5c8d7f87a9dfadb5e66dc): kops in AWS with 3 t2.medium masters and 3 t2.medium nodes spread in three availability zones, and with nginx Ingress controller.
* [devops24-eks.sh](https://gist.github.com/vfarcic/b6ed77d257964fa2e19c2722739ddad6): Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) with 3 t2.medium nodes, and with nginx Ingress controller.
* [gke.sh](https://gist.github.com/5c52c165bf9c5002fedb61f8a5d6a6d1): Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with 3 n1-standard-1 (1 CPU, 3.75GB RAM) nodes (one in each zone), with Cluster Autoscaler, and with nginx Ingress controller running on top of the "standard" one that comes with GKE.

If you are a Windows user, please use GitBash as a terminal for running the commands.

If you are running a local Kubernetes cluster with Docker For Mac/Windows, please install Vagrant (if you do not have it already).

Besides the cluster, youâ€™ll need [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).

If you have problems fulfilling the requirements, please contact me through [DevOps20](http://slack.devops20toolkit.com/) Slack (my user is vfarcic) or send me an email to viktor@farcic.com.
