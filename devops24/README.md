# Talk: Continuous Deployment To Kubernetes

## Abstract

Kubernetes is becoming a de-facto standard for container orchestration. Jenkins is already the standard for continuous deployment. How can we combine both and get the most out of both worlds?

We'll discuss continuous deployment pipeline that delivers new releases on every commit. We'll explore how to ensure that the release is safe to deploy, how to leverage Jenkins and Kubernetes features to speed up the process, and how to guarantee that new versions are running in production without risk, with zero-downtime, and without human intervention.

## Benefits

Learn how to combine Kubernetes and Jenkins to create a fully automated continuous deployment pipelines.

# Talk: Debugging Issues Discovered Through Metrics And Alerts

Saying that an application does not work correctly should not be enough by itself. We should be much more precise. Our goal is to be able to pinpoint not only which application is malfunctioning, but also which part of it is the culprit. We should be able to blame a specific function, a method, a request path, and so on. The more precise we are in detecting which part of an application is causing a problem, the faster we will find the cause of an issue. As a result, it should be easier and faster to fix the issue through a new release (a hotfix), scaling, or any other means at our disposal.

Debugging live applications using "traditional" approaches does not work any more. That is especially true when having large scale operations. We'll explore how to embrace debugging issues through metrics.

# Talk: Continuous Deployment With Jenkins X, Docker, And Kubernetes

## Abstract

Jenkins X, an open source project introduced to the community by CloudBees, enables the rapid creation, delivery and orchestration of cloud-native applications based on continuous delivery best practices and the proven Kubernetes platform.

By combining the power of Jenkins, its community and the power of Docker and Kubernetes, the Jenkins X project provides a path to the future of continuous delivery for microservices and cloud-native applications.

Jenkins X is Jenkins and additional best of breed tools and software for Kubernetes. It provides an interactive command-line interface to instantiate applications, repositories, environments, and pipelines and  orchestrate continuous integration and continuous delivery

It is the CI/CD solution for development of modern cloud applications on Kubernetes

We'll explore some of the features of Jenkins X through a hands-on demo.

## Abstract

Kubernetes is becoming a de-facto standard for container orchestration. Jenkins is already the standard for continuous deployment. How can we combine both and get the most out of both worlds?

We'll try to design a continuous deployment pipeline that delivers new releases on every commit. We'll explore how to ensure that the release is safe to deploy, how to leverage Jenkins and Kubernetes features to speed up the process, and how to guarantee that new versions are running in production without risk, with zero-downtime, and without human intervention.
