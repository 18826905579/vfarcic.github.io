# Talk: Continuous Deployment With Jenkins X And Kubernetes

## Abstract

Jenkins X, an open source project introduced to the community by CloudBees, enables the rapid creation, delivery and orchestration of cloud-native applications based on continuous delivery best practices and the proven Kubernetes platform.

By combining the power of Jenkins, its community and the power of Kubernetes, the Jenkins X project provides a path to the future of continuous delivery for microservices and cloud-native applications.

Jenkins X is Jenkins and additional best of breed tools and software for Kubernetes. It provides an interactive command-line interface to instantiate applications, repositories, environments, and pipelines and  orchestrate continuous integration and continuous delivery

It is the CI/CD solution for development of modern cloud applications on Kubernetes

We'll explore some of the features of Jenkins X through a hands-on demo.


# Workshop: The DevOps 2.4 Toolkit: Deploying Fault-Tolerant And Highly-Available Jenkins To Kubernetes

Jenkins is the de-facto standard for continuous integration, delivery, and deployment process. Docker allows us to package our applications into immutable images that can be reliably deployed anywhere. Kubernetes become undisputable king of container orchestration.

What happens when we combine the three? We'll explore the steps we might take to combine Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes into a reliable, fault-tolerant, and highly-available platform for continuous deployment processes.

Once we learn how to run Jenkins in a Kubernetes cluster, we'll proceed and design a fully-automated Jenkins pipeline that continuously builds, tests and deploys microservices into a Kubernetes cluster.

The material is based on the material from yet-to-be-published "The DevOps 2.4 Toolkit: Continuous Deployment To Kubernetes" book.
