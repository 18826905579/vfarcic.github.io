Talk Abstract
=============

The chances are that you already tried Docker. You probably started by running one of the images from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). The ease of use led you to experiment writing your own *Dockerfile* and building images from it. You tried [Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-compose). You might have realized benefits Docker provides in conjunction with microservices. Hopefully, you already deployed a container or two to production or, at least, recognized the advantages it brings to development, testing, integration and other environments and phases. All those pieces are necessary requirements for the "real deal". The final objective is to combine quite a few processes and technologies that will allow us to create a deployment pipeline. Docker makes it possible to reach nirvana. The world many thought is far from reality. The world where the last thing we do is run `git push`. From thereon, a machine takes over, and few minutes later our software is tested, built, deployed to production, and what so not. Let's see how that nirvana looks like. Let's explore which steps are required for a **fully automated continuous deployment pipeline** combined with **microservices**, and **Docker containers**.

Talk Abstract (Jenkins, Short)
==============================

Docker and Jenkins make it possible to reach nirvana. The world many thought is far from reality. The world where the last thing we do is run `git push`. From thereon, a machine takes over, and few minutes later our software is tested, built, deployed to production, and what so not. Let's see how that nirvana looks like. Let's explore which steps are required for a **fully automated continuous deployment pipeline** combined with **microservices**, *Jenkins*, and **Docker containers**.

Learning Outcomes
=================

Participants will get insights into the following concepts and their relations.

* Continuous Deployment
* Microservices
* Docker
* Clustering
* Jenkins Pipeline
* Service Discovery

Bio
===

Viktor Farcic is a Senior Consultant at CloudBees.

He coded using a plethora of languages starting with Pascal (yes, he is old), Basic (before it got Visual prefix), ASP (before it got .Net suffix), C, C++, Perl, Python, ASP.Net, Visual Basic, C#, JavaScript, etc. He never worked with Fortran. His current favorites are **Scala** and **JavaScript** even though most of his office hours are spent with **Java**.

His big passions are Microservices, Continuous Integration, Delivery and Deployment (CI/CD) and Test-Driven Development.

He often speaks at community gatherings and conferences.

He wrote the "Test-Driven Java Development" and "The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit: Automating the Continuous Deployment Pipeline with Containerized Microservices" books.
