# Why Decision Makers Need To Adopt DevOps And Continuous Delivery?

My job is developer advocacy aimed at communities as well as decision makers (C level executives). As such, I often hear a question "why should we adopt DevOps?". There is a short and a long answer to that. The short version is that you have to adopt DevOps because you have to stay alive. Your competition is adopting or already adopted DevOps. That means that your competition is being better, faster, and more reliable. Gone are the days when we could work on a project for months (or even years) before releasing it to production. As a matter a fact, even weeks long cycles are too long now. What we expect today is to deliver new features to production on weekly, daily, or even hourly basis. And why do we want that? Because that's how we manage to adapt to change. That how we continuously deliver value to our customers. More importantly, that's how your competition is operating. There should be no need to convince you that being better, faster, and more reliable is beneficial. Noone will reject that. That's the nature of business. The question that does require an answer is how to do that, and the short answer is in DevOps and continuous delivery.
