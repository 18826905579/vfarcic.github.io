* Why you wrote this book, what are you trying to answer by interviewing these people, effectively the purpose of this book.

I love sharing with others. That's my main motivation when writing books. There is a hard-to-explain joy in knowledge that our work might be helping others. But, that is not the case with this bok. This time, the motivation is much more egoistic. I wanted to understand what DevOps is. Isn't that a strange desire coming from someone who works as a consultant, usually on DevOps-related topics and who published quite a few books belonging to "The DevOps Toolkit Series"? Surely I should know what DevOps is if I am to sell my services.

DevOps is not a well defined process. There is no set of rules that must be followed. It is even questionable whether there is such a thing as a "DevOps department" or a "DevOps engineer". All we have is an idea that people should work more closely together and that we should remove barriers that slow us down. As such, anything can be DevOps. Almost every software company is marketing its products as "DevOps". "DevOps engineer" is the most sought-for role in job listings. "DevOps deparments" are popping up like mushrooms after rain. And yet, almost every person I spoke with gave me a different answer to the question "what is DevOps?"

My main objective with this book is to answer a simple question. "What is DevOps?" So, I asked many practioners. Some of them are the industry veterans, while others are up-and-comming stars. Some are my friends, while others are people I admired from afar.

I love going to conferences, but not for the obvious reasons. I rarely listen to talks. Instead, I tend to roam the corridors looking for the next victim that will allow me to pick his or her brain. The best thing about the conferences is networking. The most interesting conversations are not happening in scheduled talks, but rather in corridors, and after-parties. I consider myself lucky for being able to dedicate an important portion of my time to conferences. I know that I benefit greatly from those "corridor-talks". So, I wanted to do something similar with this book.

Each conversation starts with the innocent question "what is DevOps?". It is only meant to be the cnversation-starter and to facilitate something that is un unstructured, unpreepared, and verey casual conversation. Think of each interview as a conversation with a friend or an acquitance that I met in a pub. As a matter a fact, a few of those were recorded in a bar over a few beers.
