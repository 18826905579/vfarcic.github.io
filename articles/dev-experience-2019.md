Q: Each year we have a different concept, different speakers, different tracks and surprises. The only constant is our passion for what we do and... you. It is the fourth year in a row when you are speaking at DevExperience and we feel like you are part of the family. How do you feel about coming each year to DevExperience and what can you tell us about the evolution from the first year until now?

A: DevExperience is evolving. Year after year, the organization is better, talks are improving, and the attendees and more and more engaged. Such an evolution is not specific to DevExperience, but can be observed in many other conferences. What is special about DevExperience is the sense of community is maintained year over year. While evolution of other conferences leads to increased number of sponsored talks and overal comercialization of the conference, I feel that DevExperience keeps maintaining the spirit and the principles it had from the first edition. The main reason I keep coming back is that sense of community. When there, I feel like I'm at home, surrounded by friends.

Q: It looks like the big companies like Facebook, Netflix, Amazon etc are moving at an incredible pace while the rest of 95% are stagnating. What the others need to do to reach continuous delivery and 100+ deployments per day?

A: It is true that companies like those you mentioned are moving faster than most of the others. TODO: Continue
 
Why do you think Kubernetes is so successful? 4-5 years ago there were probably very few people that heard of it, while now the ecosystem is huge. What just happened in such a small period of time?

 
If you were now the CTO of a well established company, would you use a cloud offering for your Kubernetes platform like EKS, AKS, GKE or try building yourself with kubeadm or kops or kubicorn still on a cloud platform?

 
For a company adopting now kubernetes, what do you think their first steps should be? What should they look after when launching their first kubernetes cluster live?


Would you keep stateful applications (like a mysql or mongo database) inside a cluster? Maybe use an operator for it?


While working with the companies that adopted devops for quite some time, what are they still struggling with? What are the next silos and handovers that need to be eliminated?

 
I know that you like go now and I can see that huge projects are built with it like docker, terraform or kubernetes. But why should a backend developer start learning it, why java or .net core is not enough?


Tell us a little more about your talk at this edition of DevExperience, but also about your workshop from this year. Who should register and what will they learn there?
