# TODO: Title

DevOps is the word of the year. Everyone speaks about it, many are hoping to apply it even though most are confused what it truly means.

Inquiring about DevOps does not seem to help. If you speak with a software vendor he'll tell you that all you need to become DevOps ninja is to purchase his product. Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Docker, Terraform, Packer, Jenkins, Nexus, Git... Every software vendor seems to have a *DevOps* sticker attached to his product. You'll notice that sticker being right next to "we make Docker easy" and "we convert your architecture into microservices".

Truth be told, software vendors are not the only people offering DevOps nirvana for a moderate price and a promise eternal faithfulness. Coaches and consultants are having their moment as well even though they tend not to promote a single solution. You just need to adopt Agile across the organization, apply XP practices, implement continuous deployment, convert your applications into microservices, and attend at least three thousand daily standups. Your journey will begin once you accept all those DevOps prerequisites and commit many others that will be discovered throughout the process. Consultant will have a gig of a lifetime and you will be trilled by the prospect of reaching the promised land.

It does not end there. Job market is full of offers for a *DevOps engineer* positions even though such a thing does not exist. I'm still not sure what it even means. The most sensible explanation for such a position is that someone replaced the word operator with *DevOps engineer*. You will continue working in a silo, you will continue being in charge of the same processes and tools, and you will continue receiving JIRA tickets with requests to create a new server. But hey, you got a new title. Isn't that peachy? If, on the other hand, you're a sysadmin, don't worry. The same rules apply. Your future is secured as long as you change your title to DevOps engineer.

Now that you converted all your operations personnel and sysadmins into DevOps engineers, the next step is to employ a few more. After all, DevOps is the new thing and you have to spend the extra budget that comes with the promise of converting the organization into the next generation Disneyland.

Once you converted all operations and sysadmins into DevOps engineers and added a few more, you need to have a department. Actually, you already have a department but the name is inappropriate. Since you are brilliant and quick witted, you renamed it to DevOps department before anyone else comes to the same idea. You're not going to let anyone take away the spotlight. You've in a basement during the agile party. You didn't get the invitation and, frankly, you still hold a grudge. Now it's your time. DevOps party is about to start and you expect it to last for a couple of years if not more. And you are the star. You're on the stage and your fellow colleagues are in the front row. For a split of a second it seemed like you saw some of the agile folks as well somewhere in the back together with the rest of those with cheap tickets.

Let's go back to the chaos created by myriad of tools and practices you have to adopt if you'll ever become "DevOps certified". It become too much to handle and, as a result, we're experiencing brain overload. It's close to impossible to understand what's going on. We need to understand where we are, where we're going, and how do we plan to get there. Believe me, those questions are much harder to answer than it looks.

Figuring out where we are requires a high level of objectiveness. Answering those questions honestly will probably mean that someone will get hurt. It's never pleasant discovering that you're not at the top of the hill. It hurts finding out that, when compared with the competition, you are not as good as you thought you are. Before you start asking that question, there must be an established blameless culture that does not punish people for failures. I will assume that you are already there and can get the answers that will allow you to situate yourself (the company) within the industry as a whole and, more importantly, allow you to understand the gap between you and the leaders.

So, let's start from the beginning. The only way to figure out where we are is to go back in time and understand what brought us here.
