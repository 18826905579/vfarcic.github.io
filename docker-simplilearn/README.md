# PoC

I did around 20 slides. You can see them from [http://vfarcic.github.io/docker-simplilearn/index.html](http://vfarcic.github.io/docker-simplilearn/index.html). Please note that you can move between major section using left-right arrows. Use up-down arrows to move within a section.

I added notes only to the first 5-6 slides of the DevOps section. That's the only significant section that is purely theoretical. Almost everything else will be very hands on.

To see the presenter notes, please click the *s* key.

When you go through notes you'll notice that they are longer than what you're used to. I prefer people focusing on narrative, not on animations. However, as you'll see in the *Notes about the agreement* section, that's the part I'll leave to you. You can break them into more slides.

Please take a look and let me know what you think. If we agree to proceed, I'll move the material to a private repo and give you access to it.

# Notes about the agreement

You will not own the material I produce. You will be granted rights to create training using the raw material. I used variations of the material before and will continue using it in the future in any form I find suitable. That might include other trainings (unrelated with SimpliLearn.com).

I have the final say on the material and content of the training. You can suggest modifications but I am under no obligation to do them. The same applies to the scope and length of the training. I will take your suggestions in consideration.
