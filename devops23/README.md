# Talk: Continuously Deploying Applications To A Kubernetes Cluster

Kubernetes is becoming a de-facto standard for container orchestration. Jenkins is already the standard for continuous deployment. How can we combine both and get the most out of both worlds?

In this talk, we'll try to design a continuous deployment pipeline that delivers new releases on every commit. We'll explore how to ensure that the release is safe to deploy, how to leverage Jenkins and Kubernetes features to speed up the process, and how to guarantee that new versions are running in production without risk, with zero-downtime, and without human intervention.
