# Talk: Deploying Fault-Tolerant And Highly-Available Jenkins To Kubernetes

Jenkins is the de-facto standard for continuous integration, delivery, and deployment process. Docker allows us to package our applications into immutable images that can be reliably deployed anywhere. Kubernetes become undisputable king of container orchestration.

What happens when we combine the three? We'll explore the steps we might take to combine Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes into a reliable, fault-tolerant, and highly-available platform for continuous deployment processes.
