A cross-disciplinary community of practice dedicated to the study of building, evolving and operating rapidly-changing resilient systems at scale. - Jez Humble

DevOps is the practice of operations and development engineers participating together in the entire service lifecycle, from design through the development process to production support.


Agile creates > ops runs
Agile fast > ops slow
DevOps is a missing link for the CD
Speed, quality, flexibility
Reactive > proactive
DevOps is evolution of agile

Development: Writing code, implementing code, testing code, re-writing code, hair loss from the stress of coding, and so-forth.
Operations: All about looking after the systems that run that code. It is the operations staff who work out how much processing power the software will need to run, how to make the software secure, how to make it run efficiently, and how to keep it running.

Agile = breaking down silos between development, QA, and business analysts
DevOps adds operations and, even, architecture, to the mix
