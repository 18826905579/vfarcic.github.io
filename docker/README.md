Docker Ecosystem
================

Talk Abstract
-------------

Docker started by redefining the way we package our applications and services. With time, it became much more than that. It built an ecosystem that envelops many different aspects of the application lifecycle.

In this talk, we will explore the fast-growing Docker ecosystem. We'll see benefits we can gain from Docker Engine, Hub, Registry, Compose, Swarm, Notary, Machine, and other tools.

However, Docker ecosystem is not only a set of tools. It truly redefines the processes we use in software development. Without changing the way we architecture, deploy and deliver software, Docker adoption will provide only a fraction of the benefits. We'll explore some of those processes and changes we should consider as well as decisions we should make in an attempt to deliver more reliable software faster and cheaper.
