## What Do We Expect From Continuous Delivery?


<!-- .slide: data-background="../img/background/why.jpg" -->
# What?

---

* It needs to be cloud-native <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* It needs to bee cloud-agnostic <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* It needs to scale from zero to infinity and back <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* It needs to follow everything-as-code principle <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* It needs to be fast <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* It needs to be (very) easy <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

# How?

---

## How Do We Accomplish That?


<!-- .slide: data-background="../img/background/how.jpg" -->
# How?

---

* Design cloud-native apps <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Adopt container schedulers <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Adopt serverless <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Adopt the tools you need, remove those you don't <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


<!-- .slide: data-background="../img/background/how.jpg" -->
# How?

---

* Adopt Kubernetes as the major cross-platform cloud-agnostic container scheduler
* Adopt KNative as serverless solution in Kubernetes
* Adopt prow as GitOps and Kubernetes low-level CI/CD solution
* Adopt Helm as the standard Kubernetes packaging solution
* Facilitate quickstarts


<!-- .slide: data-background="../img/background/how.jpg" -->
# How?

---

* Join the tools and the processes into a single easy-to-use bundle
* Create an CLI-first experience
* Define an opinionated process
