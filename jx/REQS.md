You'll need **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) admin permissions**. If you don't have the account or the one you're using does not have admin permissions, please create a personal account by visiting [cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com/). You'll get $300 of free credit.

Finally, please have the name of a GCP project ready. If you don't have one, you can follow the instructions from the [Creating and Managing Projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects) documentation.
