The DevOps 2.1 Toolkit
======================

Abstract: Workshop
------------------

We'll explore the practices and tools required to run a Swarm cluster. We'll go beyond a simple deployment. We'll explore how to create a continuous deployment process. We'll set up multiple clusters. One will be dedicated to testing and the other for production. We'll see how to accomplish zero-downtime deployments, what to do in case of a failover, how to run services at scale, how to monitor the systems, and how to make it heal itself. We'll explore the processes that will allow us to run the clusters on a laptop as well as on different cloud providers.

Abstract: Webinar Jenkins
-------------------------

We'll explore the practices and tools required to run Jenkins inside a Swarm cluster. We'll go beyond a simple deployment. We'll explore how to create a continuous deployment process. We'll set up multiple clusters. One will be dedicated to testing and the other for production. We'll see how to accomplish zero-downtime deployments, what to do in case of a failover, how to run services at scale, how to monitor the systems, and how to make it heal itself. We'll explore the processes that will allow us to run the clusters on a laptop as well as on different cloud providers.

The examples will set up Jenkins master in a way that it is fault tolerant and create a dynamic cluster for running agents. Once Jenkins is up and running, we'll use Pipeline to define a continuous deployment flow for one of the services.
