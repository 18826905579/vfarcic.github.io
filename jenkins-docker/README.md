# The DevOps 2.2 Toolkit: Jenkins

## Abstract: Workshop

This workshop is based on the material published in [The DevOps 2.1 Toolkit: Building, testing, deploying, and monitoring services inside Docker Swarm clusters](https://leanpub.com/the-devops-2-1-toolkit).

The workshop will go through the whole microservices development lifecycle. We’ll start from the very beginning and define and design architecture. From there on we’ll move from requirements, technological choices and development environment setup, through coding and testing all the way until the final deployment to production. We won’t stop there. Once our new services are up and running we’ll see how to maintain them, scale them depending on resource utilization and response time, and recover them in case of failures. We’ll try to balance the need for creative manual work and the need to automate as much of the process as possible.

The goal will be to design a fully automated continuous deployment (CDP) pipeline. We’ll see how microservices fit into CDP and immutable containers concepts and why the best results are obtained when those three are combined into one unique framework.

During the workshop we’ll explore tools like Docker, Docker Swarm, Docker Compose, Jenkins, HAProxy, and a few others.

Since the subject is vast, we'll limit the scope and focus on processes and tools that are related to Jenkins. We'll build a fully automated continuous deployment pipeline.
