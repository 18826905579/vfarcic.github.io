The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit
======================

Abstract
--------

Agile changed the way we develop software, but it failed to change how we deliver it. As a result of facing new challenges, we got DevOps. We got a cross-disciplinary community of practice dedicated to the study of building, evolving and operating rapidly changing resilient systems at scale. DevOps is as much a cultural as technological change. While it united diverse teams and professionals and thought us how to automate all repetitive steps in our processes, it failed to introduce a real difference in the software landscape we use. Hence, DevOps 2.0 emerged with a drastic change in our methods, tools, and architecture. Finally, we have everything we need to build fully self-healing systems delivered to production through continuous deployment.

This talk focuses on architectural changes and new tools we should adopt to be able to tackle the problems presented by a demand for modern, responsive, fault tolerant, and elastic systems. It is based on the material published in [The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit: Automating the Continuous Deployment Pipeline with Containerized Microservices](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M) book.
