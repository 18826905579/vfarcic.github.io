Abstract
========

Microservices are becoming more and more popular and, as with every other new trend, often implemented without enough experience. Idea behind them easy to explain. Brake monolithic application into smaller independent services. That's it. That is what many think microservices are about. However, implementation is much harder to master. There are many things to consider when embarking down this path. How do we organize microservices? Which technologies to use and how? Should they be mutable or not? How to test them? How to deploy them? How to create scalable and fault tolerant systems? Self-healing, zero-downtime and logging? How should the teams be organized? Today's successful implementations of microservices require all those and many other questions to be answered. It's not only about splitting things into smaller pieces. The whole development ecosystem needs to be changed and we need to take a hard look at the microservices development lifecycle.

This workshop will go through the whole **microservices development lifecycle**. We'll start from the very beginning. We'll define and design architecture. From there on we'll move from requirements, technological choices and development environment setup, through coding and testing all the way until the final deployment to production. We won't stop there. Once our new services are up and running we'll see how to maintain them, scale them depending on resource utilization and response time, recuperate them in case of failures and create central monitoring and notifications system. We'll try to balance the need for creative manual work and the need to automate as much of the process as possible.

This will be a journey through all the aspects of the lives of microservices and everything that surrounds them. We'll see how microservices fit into continuous deployment and immutable containers concepts and why the best results are obtained when those three are combined into one unique framework.

During the workshop we'll explore tools like Docker, Docker Swarm, Docker Compose, Ansible, Consul, etcd, confd, Registrator, nginx, HAProxy, ElasticSearch, LogStash, Kibana, and so on.

Viktor Farcic is a Senior Consultant at CloudBees.

He coded using plethora of languages starting with Pascal (yes, he is old), Basic (before it got Visual prefix), ASP (before it got .Net suffix), C, C++, Perl, Python, ASP.Net, Visual Basic, C#, JavaScript, etc. He never worked with Fortran. His current favorites are **Scala** and **JavaScript** even though most of his office hours are spent with **Java**.

His big passions are Microservices, Continuous Deployment and Test-Driven Development (TDD).

He often speaks at community gatherings and conferences.

He wrote the Test-Driven Java Development book published by Packt Publishing.
