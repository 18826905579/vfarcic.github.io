# The DevOps 2.1 Toolkit: Continuous Deployment with Jenkins and Docker Swarm

## Abstract: Talk

Many of us have already experimented with Docker - for example, by running one of the pre-built images from Docker Hub. It is possible that your team might have recognized the benefits that Docker provides in building microservices and the advantages the technology could bring to development, testing, integration and, ultimately, production. The next step is to create a comprehensive build pipeline that will allow us to use Jenkins to continuously deploy services into a production environment. Integrating containers into a CD pipeline is far from easy. Along with the benefits Docker brings, there are technical and process-related challenges we need to solve.

This presentation attempts to outline the steps you need to take for a fully-automated Jenkins pipeline that continuously builds, tests and deploys microservices into a Docker Swarm cluster. Moreover, we'll explore ways to create a scalable and fault tolerant Jenkins with highly dynamic and elastic agents.
